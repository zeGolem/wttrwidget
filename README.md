# wttrwidget

## What ?

A weather "app" for windows (Not really, more of a widget) based on [wttr.in](http://www.wttr.in)

## Why ?

Because I thought it was cool

## How do I use it ?

Download the binary from the "Releases" tab, or build it yourself by reading the [build instructions](#build-instructions) to build it for yourself.
Then, just start the binary. There are no ways of making it automatically open on startup, but you can do it manually by tinkering a bit.

# Build Instructions

1) Clone/Download the repo
2) Download and install [the DotNet core SDK 3.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.0)
3) Navigate to the repo's directory and run `dotnet run` or `dotnet build` to build or run it
